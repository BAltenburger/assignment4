        "**Q1.** This question is a case study for linear models and decision trees. The data are about car prices. In particular, they include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `Price`, `Color`, `Seating_Capacity`\n",
        "  - `Body_Type`: crossover, hatchback, muv, sedan, suv\n",
        "  - `Make`, `Make_Year`: The brand of car and year produced\n",
        "  - `Mileage_Run`: The number of miles on the odometer\n",
        "  - `Fuel_Type`: Diesel or gasoline/petrol\n",
        "  - `Transmission`, `Transmission_Type`:  speeds and automatic/manual\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Load `cars_hw.csv`. These data were really dirty, and I've already cleaned them a significant amount in terms of missing values and other issues, but some issues remain (e.g. outliers, badly scaled variables that require a log or arcsinh transformation). Clean the data however you think is most appropriate.\n",
        "  2. Summarize the `Price` variable and create a kernel density plot. Use `.groupby()` and `.describe()` to summarize prices by brand (`Make`). Make a grouped kernel density plot by `Make`. Which car brands are the most expensive? What do prices look like in general?\n",
        "  3. Split the data into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.\n",
        "  4. Let's focus on linear models. Make a model where you regress price on the numeric variables alone; what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Make a second model where, for the categorical variables, make a model comprised of one-hot encoded regressors/features alone, and regress price on those variables; what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Which model performs better on the test set? Make a third model that combines all the regressors from the previous two; what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Does the joint model perform better or worse, and by home much?\n",
        "  5. Use the `PolynomialFeatures` function from `sklearn` to expand the set of numerical variables you're using, along with the categorical variables. As you increase the degree of the expansion, how do the $R^2$ and `RMSE` change? At what point does $R^2$ go negative on the test set? For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 3?\n",
        "  6. For your best model so far, determine the predicted values for the test data and plot them against the true values. Do the predicted values and true values roughly line up along the diagonal, or not? Compute the residuals/errors for the test data and create a kernel density plot. Do the residuals look roughly bell-shaped around zero? Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your model.\n",
        "  7. Now, let's use a regression tree. Construct an appropriate matrix of regressors/features, and fit a tree to the data. Vary the maximum depth of the decision tree using the `max_depth` option (i.e. `tree.DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=D)`), and compute the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set of a variety of depths. What depth tree gives the best results?\n",
        "  8. For your best tree, determine the predicted values for the test data, and plot them against the true values. Do the predicted values and true values line up along the diagonal, or not? Compute the residuals/errors for the test data and create a kernel density plot. Do the residuals look roughly bell-shaped around zero?\n",
        "  12. Which model --- linear model or classification and regression tree --- has better performance on the test set?"
